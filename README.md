Backend API - Project Documentation
Project Overview
The Backend API is part of a MERN stack application, providing a RESTful API designed to handle user authentication, data management, and file handling. Built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and TypeScript, this backend is structured for security, scalability, and efficient performance.

Key Features:
Authentication & Authorization: Utilizes JWT for authentication, with bcryptjs for secure password hashing.
File Handling: Supports file uploads using multer, handling various file types.
Logging: Implements request logging using morgan for debugging and monitoring.
Environment Configuration: Configuration is managed using dotenv, allowing seamless management of environment-specific settings.
Project Setup
Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure the following tools and services are installed:

Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
npm
MongoDB (either local or cloud instance like MongoDB Atlas)
Installation Steps
Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine by running:


git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
Install Dependencies
Install all required dependencies for both production and development environments:


npm install
Setup Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and define the following environment variables:


MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://test-kyc:B8BO5IdCv15eSaIq@test.rg8yk.mongodb.net/
JWT_SECRET="secret-key-your"
PORT=5001
Start the Backend Server
To run the backend server in development mode, execute the following command. The server will automatically restart on code changes (thanks to nodemon):


npm run dev
The server will run on the port specified in the .env file (default: 5001).

Frontend Integration
If integrating with the frontend, configure your frontend application to make API calls to the backend URL.

Assumptions and Design Decisions
Assumptions:
The project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
MongoDB is the database, and the necessary connection details are configured in the .env file.
JWT is used for authentication, and bcryptjs is used for hashing passwords securely.
Multer is used for handling file uploads on the server.
Design Decisions & Trade-offs:
Authentication: The project uses JWT for stateless authentication. While this is suitable for most applications, for apps requiring multi-device support, OAuth or other token management strategies could be more appropriate.
File Upload Handling: Multer is used for local file uploads. For higher scalability, especially with larger file sizes, external storage solutions like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage may be a better fit.
Logging: The morgan library is used to log HTTP requests. For production, consider using more advanced logging solutions like Winston or integrating with a monitoring tool (e.g., Datadog).
Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented. For production-grade applications, a more comprehensive error management system, such as centralized logging or tools like Sentry, can be used.
TypeScript Setup
This backend project is written in TypeScript for improved type safety and scalability. The following TypeScript-related dependencies are used:

typescript: TypeScript language support.
@types/node: Type definitions for Node.js.
@types/express: Type definitions for Express.js.
Development Dependencies:
@types/bcryptjs: Type definitions for bcryptjs.
@types/cookie-parser: Type definitions for cookie-parser.
@types/cors: Type definitions for CORS.
@types/jsonwebtoken: Type definitions for JSON Web Token.
@types/morgan: Type definitions for morgan.
@types/multer: Type definitions for multer.
